The main difference between BCE and CE is that BCE is used for binary classification tasks, where there are two possible classes. However, CE can be used for  multi-class classification tasks, where there are more than two classes. Therefore, the labels of BCE and CE have different meanings, in BCE case, we normally will use sigmoid function as activation function because the float value between 0 and 1 can represent the probability of the sample which is suitable for the binary class membership. As for the CE class, the target label for each sample is represented as an integer, indicating the index of the true class among multiple classes. Therefore, the softmax activation function is applied to these neurons to transform the real-valued outputs into class probabilities.\n","\n","##### 2. In the model architecture coding part, we changed the last output line \"nn.linear(256,2)\", the reason that we change to 2 is because in CE loss case, the neurons means the number of classes and it computes a weighted sum of the input values for each class. Therefore, in our case choosing 2 is because we only class 0 and 1 for normal and abnormal, respectively.\n","\n","##### 3. For the change #1, compared to BCE loss, the label of CE loss is used to compare the probability distribution of network outputs with the true class labels, which are integer indices; therefore,we should use \".long\" to change to integers to represent the true class for each sample. For the change #2, unlike BCE loss that need to distinguish the probabliity, CE loss uesd \"outputs.argmax(-1)\" to find the index of the class with the highest probability for each sample. Moreover, the index \"-1\" means the last axis of the tensor, so argmax(-1) is used to find the index of the maximum value along the last axis."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vxAUTEEIZPOj"},"source":["### ✏️ Task B: Creating an Evaluation Code (20 pts)\n","\n","Evaluate the performance of a pretrained deep learning model with a test dataset of chest X-ray images available in `test_normal.npy` and `test_pneumonia.npy` files.
